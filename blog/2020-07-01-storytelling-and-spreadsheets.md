This [tweet](https://twitter.com/JamesClear/status/1229913599151353857?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) caught my attention. It says:

<blockquote><p>The two skills of modern business: <br /><br />Storytelling and spreadsheets. <br /><br />Know the numbers. Craft the narrative.</p></blockquote>

It got me thinking...

Both parts, the storytelling and the spreadsheets mean something to me. On both personal and business levels. After all, you can tell a story in Excel with charts.

I read the quote and see it as positive. Another part of me recongises that some might see one, or both, parts as problematic. I want to explore this in a little more depth - starting with storytelling.

Instragram influencers
PR

Other extreme. Academics who want to see the data and nothing else.

If you believe a chart in a paper has no accompanying message then you're missing out on part of the picture.

Media bias is an often discussed topic. My take has long been that all media, all **people**, come with biases. And I have much more respect for a newspaper or journalist who declares what informs their opinions than for the case where they claim no bias at all.

Back to storytelling

And finally back to charts

My plea to you is to give a little care and attention to what you want your chart to say. Sales are up! Growth is flat. You can be honest. If the data doesn't show anything in particular then feel comfortable having it say so. Don't be afraid of informative titles!

Chart with boring title, e.g. Sales

Chart with informative title, e.g. Quarterly sales numbers show no trend
