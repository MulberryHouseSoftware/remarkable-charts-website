## Format a date the way you want

[Microsoft documentation](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/format-a-date-the-way-you-want-8e10019e-d5d8-47a1-ba95-db95123d273e#ID0EAACAAA=Windows)

When you enter some text into a cell such as **"2/2"**, Excel assumes that this is a date and formats it according to the default date setting in Control Panel. Excel might format it as **"2-Feb"**. If you change your date setting in Control Panel, the default date format in Excel will change accordingly. If you donâ€™t like the default date format, you can choose another date format in Excel, such as **"February 2, 2012"** or **"2/2/12"**. You can also create your own custom format in Excel desktop.

## Millions and billions

This requires you to [create a custom mumber format](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create-a-custom-number-format-78f2a361-936b-4c03-8772-09fab54be7f4).

:::important Compatibility
You **can't** create custom formats in Excel for the web but if you have the Excel desktop application, you can click the **Open in Excel** button to open the workbook and create them.
