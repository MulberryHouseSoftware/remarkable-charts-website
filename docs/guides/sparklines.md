A sparkline is a tiny chart that provides a simple overview of data. Use sparklines to show trends in a series of values, such as seasonal increases or decreases, economic cycles, or to highlight maximum and minimum values.

## How do I create a sparkline?

Resize the chart to make it smaller. That's all

## Anything else I should know?

Sparklines can only show a single data series. If you have more than one series (column) then we only show the first.
